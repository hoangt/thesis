\chapter{gem5 Accuracy}

There exists related work that claims a very high accuracy for
gem5\cite{butko2012accuracy,blem2013detailed}, but the results states good
accuracy for benchmark programs with a high diversity of instructions. A common
factor for much of this related work is that the benchmarks have been run with
simple CPU models that are single cycle and in-order, but timing-adjusted to fit
the performance of the real hardware.

We claim that the key to obtain high precision power estimates is an
architectural simulator with great accuracy. The simulator must exhibit similar
timing characteristics as the target hardware under all workloads considered,
such that the simulated execution resembles the hardware execution as much as
possible. The scheme suggested in this thesis is based on accumulation of
discrete events, each with an assigned weight according to its contribution to
the global power consumption. This means that accurate power estimation needs
these discrete events to happen, and they must happen with a realistic timing
related to their triggering cause.

Without a simulator capable of providing decent accuracy over system events,
power estimation using methods as suggested in this report will fail. We will
now explain how gem5 can be configured to improve simulator accuracy for a
particular CPU core, as well as pointing out difficulties with this approach.
