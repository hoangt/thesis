\chapter{gem5 Accuracy}

A key to high accuracy power estimation is a high accuracy architectural
simulator. Without a simulator capable of providing decent accuracy over system
events, power estimation using methods as suggested in this report will fail.
There exists related work that claims a very high accuracy for
gem5\cite{butko2012accuracy,blem2013detailed}, but the results states
good accuracy for benchmark programs with a high diversity of instructions. A common
factor for much of this related work is that the benchmarks have been run with
simple CPU models that are single cycle and in-order, but timing-adjusted to fit
the performance of the real hardware.

The power estimation scheme suggested in this thesis is based on accumulation of discrete
events, each with an assigned weight related to its contribution of the global power consumption.
This means that accurate power estimation needs these discrete events to happen, and they must
happen with a realistic timing related to their triggering cause. This chapter will dive into
how well gem5 does this, but also problems that one must be aware of when using gem5 or any
other simulator this way.
