\section{gem5 CPU Model}

PET relies heavily on a front-end that can execute a binary on a simulator and
output $(time, event)$ tuples to a trace file. We are using the gem5 simulator,
but technically PET could be modified to support any simulator front-end.
Several factors affect the accuracy of the model and there are several points of
tuning and optimization throughout the workflow. The power profile coming from
PET are derived from the weight configuration given as input and the simulation
trace, so it is important that the simulator trace is similar to a hardware
execution.
