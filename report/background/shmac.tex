\section{SHMAC}

SHMAC is a hardware prototype of a Single-ISA Heterogeneous MAny-core Com-
puter. It is an ongoing research project within the Energy Efficient Computing
Systems (EECS) research area at the Department of Computer and Information
Science at NTNU. The SHMAC project is driven by the \textit{dark silicon
effect}; as transistors become smaller, only parts of a chip can be powered
simulataneously.
