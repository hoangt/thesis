\section{SHMAC}

SHMAC is a hardware prototype of a Single-ISA Heterogeneous MAny-core Computer
\cite{shmacsliedes, shmacwebpage, Rusten567042}. It is an ongoing research
project within the Energy Efficient Computing Systems (EECS) research area at
the Department of Computer and Information Science at NTNU. The SHMAC project is
driven by the \textit{dark silicon effect}: as transistors become smaller, only
parts of a chip can be powered simulataneously \cite{esmaeilzadeh2011dark}.
SHMAC implements two main strategies to mitigate the dark silicon effect,
heterogeneity and specialization.

The SHMAC architecture is tile-based. Processing elements are laid out in a
rectangular grid with connections to their nearest neighbor, as depicted in
\autoref{fig:shmac}. A router protocol present in all SHMAC tiles handles
communication and data flow between tiles. The great deal about SHMAC is that
different kinds of specialized tiles/accelerators can be composed as desired, to
form a computer tailored to the application. With the ability to evaluate
different tiles with respect to energy and performance, the most advantageous
core composition can be chosen.
