\section{Hardware Platform}

The Samsung Exynos 4412 ``Prime'' is a modern System-on-Chip featuring four ARM
Cortex-A9 CPU cores, Mali-400 GPU and 2GB of on-chip DRAM. It is being used on
the ODROID-X2 development platform designed by Hardkernel\cite{hardkernel}.

The Cortex-A9 is an out-of-order dual-issue speculative RISC processor. It is
designed with energy efficiency in mind and is primarily found in low-powered
embedded devices such as smartphones and tablets. After the decode stage, an
out-of-order multi-issue module with speculation can schedule two arithmetic
operations, in which one can be a multiply (the processor has only one hardware
multiply unit). It also has a multiplexed lane for address operations and
floating point operations (the \emph{NEON} FPU). The Cortex-A9 is often used as 1-4 cores\cite{armsite},
where the implementation used on the Exynos 4412 is a 4-core variant\cite{somesite}. In this
experiment, 3 of the cores are disabled to ease both the measurement and the
simulation process.

For simulation correctness, good architectural knowledge is crucial, but most
proparitary architectures have a lot of details that remain undisclosed to the
public. Different sources have been used to find properties needed by the simulater,
some details regarding the OoO cores can be read about in \cite{blem2013detailed}.
