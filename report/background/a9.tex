\section{Hardware Platform}

The Samsung Exynos 4412 ``Prime'' is a modern System-on-Chip featuring a quad
core ARM Cortex-A9 CPU, Mali-400 GPU and 2GB of on-chip DRAM. It is being used
on the ODROID-X2 development platform designed by Hardkernel.

The Cortex-A9 is an out-of-order dual-issue speculative RISC processor. It is
designed with energy efficiency in mind and is primarily found in low-powered
embedded devices such as smartphones. However, mobile processors are becoming
increasingly popular in alternative domains, such as supercomputing, due to
their low cost and good performance-per-watt ratio. Building datacenters from
low-cost embedded processors is believed to have a massive potential and change
the landscape of supercomputing the years to come.

Not only datacenters benefit from the use of mobile processors. The SHMAC
research project at NTNU aims to build a single-ISA heterogeneous computing
platform with processing cores tailored to the application. Using the most
effective processor or hardware accelerator, in terms of both energy efficiency
and performance is crucial.

For simulation correctness, good architectural knowledge is crucial, but most
proparitary architectures have a lot of details that remain undisclosed to the
public. Different sources have been used to find properties needed by the simulater,
some details regarding the OoO cores can be read about in \cite{blem2013detailed}.
