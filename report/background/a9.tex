\section{Hardware Platform}

The Samsung Exynos 4412 ``Prime'' is a modern System-on-Chip featuring a quad
core ARM Cortex-A9 CPU, Mali-400 GPU and 2GB of on-chip DRAM. It is being used
on the ODROID-X2 development platform designed by Hardkernel.

The Cortex-A9 is an out-of-order dual-issue speculative RISC processor. It is
designed with energy efficiency in mind and is primarily found in low-powered
embedded devices such as smartphones. However, mobile processors are becoming
increasingly popular in alternative domains, such as supercomputing, due to
their low cost and good performance-per-watt ratio. Building datacenters from
low-cost embedded processors is believed to have a massive potential and change
the landscape of supercomputing the years coming.

Not only datacenters benefit from the use of mobile processors. The SHMAC
research project at NTNU aims to build a single-ISA heterogeneous computing
platform with processing cores tailored to the application. Using the most
effective processor or hardware accelerator, in terms of both energy efficiency
and performance is crucial.
