\section{Hardware Platform}

The Samsung Exynos 4412 ``Prime'' is a modern System-on-Chip featuring a quad
core ARM Cortex-A9 CPU, Mali-400 GPU and 2GB of on-chip DRAM. It is being used
on the ODROID-X2 development platform designed by Hardkernel.

The Cortex-A9 is an out-of-order dual-issue speculative RISC processor. It is
designed with energy efficiency in mind and is primarily found in low-powered
embedded devices such as smartphones and tablets.

For simulation correctness, good architectural knowledge is crucial, but most
proparitary architectures have a lot of details that remain undisclosed to the
public. Different sources have been used to find properties needed by the simulater,
some details regarding the OoO cores can be read about in \cite{blem2013detailed}.
