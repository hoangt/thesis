\section{CPU Energy Measurements}

High quality instruction level energy models can be derived for pipelined
processors by monitoring the instantaneous current drawn by the processor at
each clock cycle \cite{nikolaidis2005instruction}. As modern processors commonly
operate at a few GHz, expensive measurement devices are required to sample
at sufficient frequency. 

In \cite{rundehvatum2013exploring}, we conducted experiments to quantify the
energy cost of an instruction executing on a modern out-of-order mobile
processor while sampling at significantly lower rate. We were able to do this by
completely bypassing the memory hierarchy utilizing special hardware
(\emph{fast-loop mode}) and sampling a running average.

The ultimate goal in this context is to estimate power consumption and energy
efficiency of new hardware, the first step is to measure different more or less
power consuming events on real hardware that is similar to the one simulated.
