\section{Energy Consumption in CPUs}

Two sources of energy consumption in a CPU can be distinguished: static and
dynamic. Static energy consumption is caused by a small current continuously
leaking through the transistors, while dynamic is due to charges being moved
towards ground when transistors are toggling \cite{wolf}.
\autoref{fig:staticdynamic} shows how current flows through a NOT gate at the
transistor level. The green arrow indicates where static leakage occurs and the
two red arrows shows where charges escapes when switching. As feature size
decreases, a significant part of overall energy consumption is due to static
leakage \cite{nguyen2003minimization}. This means that simply powering the chip
without any toggling generates a significant amount of heat
\cite{kim2003leakage,martin2002combined}. Static power consumption origins
from transistor size and layout, while dynamic power consumption depends on the
amount of transistor switching. From an architectural point of view, the dynamic
power consumption is easier to influence.
