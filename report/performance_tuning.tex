\chapter{PET Performance Tuning}

Several factors affect the PET model accuracy. We now consider the steps needed
to adapt the use of PET on a new architecture. First, one must create a CPU
model using gem5's Python interface, resembling the modeled hardware. Then,
finding proper weights is formulated as a global optimization problem and
matched up against existing hardware.
