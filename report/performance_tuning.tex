\chapter{PET Performance Tuning}

Several factors affect the PET model accuracy. To improve accuracy, there are
many points to tune and optimize throughout the workflow. We now consider the
steps needed to adapt the use of PET on a new CPU platform. First, one must
create a CPU model using gem5's Python interface, resembling the modeled
hardware. Then, finding correct weights is formulated as a global optimization
problem.
