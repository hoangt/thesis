\chapter{PET Performance Tuning}

Several factors affect the accuracy of the model and there are several points of
tuning and optimization throughout the workflow. We now consider the steps
needed to adapt the use of PET on a new CPU platform. First, one must create a
CPU model using gem5's Python interface, resembling the modelled hardware. Then,
finding correct weights is formulated as a global optimization problem.
