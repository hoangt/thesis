\section{Measuring a Real World Example Processor}

The results contributed through this work relies on the existence of a method to
isolate and measure core voltage on a hardware implemented reference CPU. This
is possible due to the $V_{core}$ separation on our development kit, as
mentioned in \autoref{sec:hw}.

In \cite{rundehvatum2013exploring}, we conducted experiments to quantify the
energy cost of an instruction executing on a modern out-of-order mobile
processor. We were able to do this by completely bypassing the memory hierarchy
utilizing special hardware (\emph{fast-loop mode}) and sampling a running
average. Voltage drop over a shunt resistor such as the one shown in
\autoref{fig:shunt} was set in series with the ODROID-X2 development board is
measured, and we calculate energy used in the processor core. The results
obtained are further used to tune PET towards this architecture.
