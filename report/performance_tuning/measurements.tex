\section{Measuring a Real World Processor}

The results contributed in this work relies on the existence of a method to
isolate and measure core voltage on a hardware implemented reference CPU. This
is possible due to the $V_{core}$ separation on the development kit, as
mentioned in \autoref{sec:hw}.

In \cite{rundehvatum2013exploring}, we conducted experiments to quantify the
energy cost of an instruction executing on a modern out-of-order mobile
processor. We were able to do this by completely bypassing the memory hierarchy
utilizing special hardware (\emph{fast-loop mode}) and sampling a running
average. Voltage drop over a shunt resistor set in series with the ODROID-X2
development board was measured. This voltage drop was used to calculate energy
used in the processor core. The results obtained are further used to tune PET
towards this architecture.
