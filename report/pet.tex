\chapter{Building a Power Estimation Tool}

As we are already well supplied with a decent computer architecture simulator
capable of tracing all sorts of hardware events, the next step is to be able to
extract power information from these event logs. This thesis presents such a
Power Estimation Tool, called PET. PET provides guided information about power
usage for new architectures, and represents a major piece of our problem
solution. The following chapters will describe how it works along with it's
strengths and weaknesses.

\noindent Source code for PET lives at github.com and can be checked out with

usage
- input-format, input-parameter
- kjøring av gem5, flagg, se-mode
- (kryss)-kompilering av test-programmer
output
- plain, table, graph
- annotering (med eksempler på hvordan man får tak i dette)
