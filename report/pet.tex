\chapter{Building a Power Estimation Tool}

The ultimate goal for this project is to model and estimate energy consumption
for not yet implemented computer architectures. This allows new ideas to be prototyped
and evaluated with respect to energy efficiency already ad the the design stage,
easing the process of building energy efficient hardware. These evaluations can
only serve as estimates and will doubtedly be truly accurate. Nevertheless, it
can be used to test specific workloads and applications on specific processor
configurations and evaluate ideas rapidly during the design phase.

As we are already supplied with a computer architecture simulator capable of
tracing all sorts of hardware events, the next step is to extract power
information from these event logs. In this chapter we introduce PET, a Power
Estimation Tool. PET provides guided information about power usage for new
architectures and represents a major piece of our problem solution. The
chapters to follow describe how it works along with it's strengths and
weaknesses.

\noindent The source code for PET can be found at github.com and can be checked out with
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,numbers=none]
git clone https://github.com/terjr/thesis.git
\end{lstlisting}

\input{pet/concept.tex}
\input{pet/approach.tex}
\input{pet/input.tex}
\input{pet/output.tex}
\input{pet/architecture.tex} % this ended up as a "gluing it all together"-section. OK?
