\chapter{Conclusion and Further Work}

In this thesis, we have examined the construction of a power estimate tool for
unimplemented computer architectures by leveraging power measurements of a real
processor combined with a genetic algorithm and an architectural simulator. The
following sections will relate the obtained results to the initial goals for the
assignment, and provide a review of interesting topics for further work.
