\chapter{Conclusion and Further Work}

In this thesis, we have taken advantage of hardware measurements on real
hardware and an architectural simulator to create a power estimation tool. The
following sections will highlight our contribution, discuss use cases and relate
it to existing solutions. We will also provide a review of interesting topics
for further work.
