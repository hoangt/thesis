\chapter{Background}
Beeing able to estimate power usage for hardware designs that are not yet implemented
is an important part of reaching an energy efficient design. Never the less, power estimation
of chips in general is a complex matter. This chapter will give a sufficient introduction
to power meassurement on real hardware, hardware simulation and parameter optimization.
