\chapter{Background}
Being able to estimate power usage for hardware designs that are not yet
implemented is an important part of reaching an energy efficient design. Never
the less, power estimation of chips in general is a complex matter. This chapter
will give a sufficient introduction to power meassurement on real hardware,
hardware simulation and parameter optimization.
