\section{Further work}

PET has proven to work quite well with the ARM Cortex-A9, but still no effort at
all has been put into verifying that the concept works for multiple
architectures.  Testing against other both realized and non-realized processors
has to be done. An interesting experiment would be to compare the accuracy of
PET to tools that work on the RTL-level, even though the major purpose of PET is
to point in the right direction rather than hitting spot on values for energy
usage.

An other important section where PET could provide useful is in the development of memory
hierarchies. PET has not been tested very well for this purpose as it is not clear from
the provided data sheets how the main memory is powered on the ODROID-X2 platform. A similar
experiment on fully disclosed hardware would most likely provide much more fruitful information
for the entire idea of event based power consumption prediction.
