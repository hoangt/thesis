\section{Further work}

PET has proven to work quite well with the ARM Cortex-A9, but it remains to be
tested against other both realized and non-realized processors. An interesting
experiment would be to compare its accuracy to RTL-level tools, even though the
major purpose of PET is to point in the right direction rather than hitting spot
on values for energy usage.

PET is also not tested very well for memory hierarchies, as it is not clear from
the provided data sheets which power rail that supplies the main memory.
