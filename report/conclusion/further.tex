\section{Further Work}

PET has proven to work quite well with the ARM Cortex-A9, but no effort has been
put into verifying that the concept works for multiple architectures. Testing
against other both realized and non-realized processors is yet to be done. An
other important section where PET could prove useful, is in the development of
memory hierarchies. PET has not been tested very well for this purpose as it is
not clear from the provided data sheets how the main memory is powered on the
ODROID-X2 platform. A similar experiment on fully disclosed hardware would most
likely provide much more accurate information for the idea of event based power
consumption prediction. An interesting experiment would be to compare the
accuracy of PET to tools that work on the RTL-level, even though the major
purpose of PET is rough estimation rather than correct predictions.

When it comes to the SHMAC project, an important piece of work will be to use
PET and its ideas early in the design phase. Taking advantage of this can can
shorten the path to more energy efficient tiles.
