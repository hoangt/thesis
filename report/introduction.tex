\chapter{Introduction}

The steep increase in single-threaded performance seen over the last decades is
decelerating and seems to be flattening out. \autoref{fig:cpuperformance} shows
how Moore's law is still continuing \cite{moore1965cramming,
tanenbaum1984structured}, but as we have seen the end of Dennard scaling
\cite{dennard1974design,esmaeilzadeh2011dark}, power density increases as more
transistors is crammed together. Today, computer architects are struggling for
more energy efficient solutions in order to avoid the dark silicon effect and
gain further performance.

--------------------------------



The field of computer science have reached an era where further boost in
single-threaded performance is rapidly becoming more difficult. Up until recent,
single-threaded performance increased linearly along with the shrinking of transistors as
seen in \autoref{fig:cpuperformance}.
As predicted by Gordon Moore, hardware designers were able to cram more logic
onto the CPU dies, thus allowing for more and more clever ways of doing the
common things fast \cite{moore1965cramming}. As transistors scaled down, so did
the voltage needed to keep the logic doing its work \cite{dennard1974design}. We
have now seen the end of Dennard scaling \cite{esmaeilzadeh2011dark} and voltage scaling
does no longer apply. This leaves us with a higher power density every time
more components are added, making it a lot harder to achieve higher performance.
