\chapter{Introduction}

The steep increase in single-threaded performance during the last few decades
seems to have come to an end. \autoref{fig:cpuperformance} shows how Moore's law
is continuing \cite{moore1965cramming, tanenbaum1984structured}; the transistor
count on-die is still increasing exponentially. As we have seen the end of
Dennard scaling \cite{dennard1974design,esmaeilzadeh2011dark}, power density
increases as more transistors is crammed together. Too much power on a tiny area
leads to more heat than conventional cooling solutions can dissipate. Today,
computer designers are striving to achieve higher performance without further
increase in power density.
