\chapter{Introduction and Motivation}

This thesis looks into many aspects regarding prediction of energy consumption
on both existing and non-existing hardware. Methods for mapping power
consumption to specific events at the architectural level are looked into.
Further, a program that leverages modern architectural simulators for
power-aware hardware development are being created and evaluated.
