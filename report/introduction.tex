\chapter{Introduction}

The field of computer science have reached an era where further boost in
single-threaded performance is rapidly becoming more difficult. Up until recent,
single-threaded performance increased linearly along with the shrinking of transistors as
seen in \autoref{fig:cpuperformance}.
As predicted by Gordon Moore, hardware designers were able to cram more logic
onto the CPU dies, thus allowing for more and more clever ways of doing the
common things fast \cite{moore1965cramming}. As transistors scaled down, so did
the voltage needed to keep the logic doing its work \cite{dennard1974design}. We
have now seen the end of Dennard scaling \cite{esmaeilzadeh2011dark} and voltage scaling
does no longer apply. This leaves us with a higher power density every time
more components are added, making it a lot harder to achieve higher performance.
