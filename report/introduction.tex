\chapter{Introduction}

The field of computer science have reached an era where further boost in
single-threaded performance is increasingly complex. Even though Moore's law
\cite{moore1965cramming} is still going strong, Dennard scaling
\cite{dennard1974design} has already dropped far out a few years ago.
\autoref{fig:cpuperformance} sketches up the current state of the art, and it is
easy to see that even though the numbers of transistors per chip is still
increasing, single-threaded performance has flatted out along with frequency and
wattage.

The reason for this flattening out of performance, frequency and wattage is
mainly because of the Dark Silicon Effect \cite{esmaeilzadeh2011dark}, the
phenomenon of too high power density to be able to cool down a fully powered
chip with ordinary cooling solutions. Where earlier designs exploited a higher
transistor count by adding faster, but more complex components to their designs,
this is no longer possible as it would create too much heat.
