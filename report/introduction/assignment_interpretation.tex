\section{Assignment Interpretation}

Based on the assignment description text, the following main tasks were
identified.

\begin{description}
    \item[Task 1:] Quantify the exact cost of executing specific instructions on
        a modern out-of-order CPU core
    \item[Task 2:] Create a simulator suite that underpins the importance of
        energy efficiency during software execution under various workloads
\end{description}

As can be seen, the problem is twofold. \textit{Task 1} involves taking energy
measurements on hardware components to obtain numbers of a processors energy
characteristics. \textit{Task 2} depends on the results from the former and can
be solved after the completion of \textit{Task 1}.

The first task was solved as a part of the specialization project (TDT4501)
during the fall of 2013, and the final report in its entirity is attached in
\autoref{RH13}. The review of \textit{Task 2} is the main emphasis of this
master's thesis.
