\section{Assignment Interpretation}

Based on the assignment description text, the following main tasks were
identified.

\begin{description}
    \item[Task 1:] Quantify the exact cost of executing specific instructions on
        a modern out-of-order CPU core.
    \item[Task 2:] Create a software suite that accentuate energy consumption
        during software execution on various hardware.
\end{description}

\textit{Task 1} involves performing energy measurements on hardware components
to obtain numbers of a processors energy characteristics. \textit{Task 2}
depends on the results from the former and can only be solved after the
completion of \textit{Task 1}.

\textit{Task 1} was solved as a part of the specialization project (TDT4501)
during the fall of 2013, and the final report in its entirety is attached in
\autoref{RH13}. The review of \textit{Task 2} is the main emphasis of this
master's thesis. In order to solve it, a simulation environment must be created
and combined with a method for power estimation.
