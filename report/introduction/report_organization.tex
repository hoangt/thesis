    \item[Chapter 1: Introduction] provides a historical perspective to the
        trends in processor design and motivates the need for energy efficient
        hardware.
    \item[Chapter 2: Background] contains background material on topics touched
        in this thesis, as well as explanations that support decisions made
        later in the report.
    \item[Chapter 3: Building a Power Estimation Tool] is the main piece of our
        problem solution. It contains an in-detail review of what PET does and
        how it is built.
    \item[Chapter 4: PET Performance Tuning] describes what one must consider
        when porting the use of PET to support new hardware configurations.
    \item[Chapter 5: Experiments and Results] presents the test setup and
        performance obtained from our experiments.
    \item[Chapter 6: Conclusion and Further Work] provides the concluding remarks on the work
        described in this thesis and suggests possible areas of interest for
        further research.
