\section{Report Organization}

\begin{description}
    \item[Chapter 1: Introduction] provides a historical perspective to the
        trends in processor design and motivates the need for energy efficient
        hardware.
    \item[Chapter 2: Background] contains supportive material on subjects used
        throughout this thesis, as well as explanations that justify decisions
        made later in the report.
    \item[Chapter 3: Building a Power Estimation Tool] is the main piece of our
        problem solution. It contains an in-detail review of what PET does and
        how it is built.
    \item[Chapter 4: PET Performance Tuning] describes considerations needed
        when porting the use of PET to support new hardware configurations.
    \item[Chapter 5: Experiments and Results] presents the tests used to
        evaluate PET, along with accuracy and performance data.
    \item[Chapter 6: Conclusion and Further Work] provides the concluding remarks on the work
        described in this thesis and suggests possible areas of interest for
        further research.
