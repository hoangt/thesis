\section{Motivation}

\subsection{Historical Perspective}

Ever since the birth of computers, the world has seen an ever-increasing demand
for computing power. In present time, computers have become a vital part of the
society, supporting operations in government, health care and economics.
Personal computers have become ubiquitous and have found uses ranging from home
entertainment systems to portable tablet computers. As applications in all these
segments becomes richer, they demand even better performance. Home users require
higher frame rates on their multimedia applications, researchers can perform
more accurate simulations with more powerful computer systems and wireless
networks can increase connectivity with better encoding schemes.

To meet the increasing demand for performance throughout the 80's and 90's,
hardware designers were forced to optimize the processors designs. They were
able increase single-threaded performance tremendously as displayed in
\autoref{fig:moore} by exploiting instruction level parallelism and increasing
frequency, doubling the performance every 18th month. The tradeoff, however, was
added complexity to the processor core. Greater complexity required a greater
amount of transistors which must fit on the same die, made possible by the
reduction of transistor size. For a long time, new process technologies allowed
for smaller and less energy consuming transistors, but as we approached the end
of Dennard scaling \cite{dennard}, there was suddenly no free lunch. Heat
generation on-chip became overwhelming and one could not simply increase the
frequency to gain additional performance.

\subsection{Problems of the New World}

Today's hardware designers are facing really hard problems. They must
continue to deliver performance boosts year after year, while maintaining
or even lowering the energy consumption. Performance alone is no longer the most
important attribute of processors, energy efficiency is even more important.

% driftkostnad, kombinasjon

To remedy this, hardware designers now emphasize energy efficiency over pure
performance; a processor's performance per Watt is currently the measure
designers seeks to maximize. Indeed, the overall performance must also improve,
forcing designers to employ novel techniques.

Processors targeting laptops, cellphones and other mobile devices has always
been energy-constrained due to their battery-powered nature. Processors in this
segment trades off performance in return of increased energy efficiency. More
recently, however, mobile processors has become increasingly popular in
alternative domains too, such as supercomputing. Their low cost and good
performance per Watt ratio makes them attractive for massively parallel
problems: Building datacenters from low-cost embedded processors is believed to
have a huge potential and change the landscape of supercomputing the years to
come.

Not only data centers benefit from the use of mobile processors. The SHMAC
research project at NTNU aims to build a single-ISA heterogeneous computing
platform with processing cores tailored to the application. Using the most
effective processor or hardware accelerator -- in terms of both energy
and performance -- is the key to success for such platforms.

\subsection{Better Tools for Optimizing Energy Efficiency}

Given the advanced tools used to design hardware present these days, it is more
easy than ever to change, model and simulate performance and behaviour. With
these possibilities, tools to visualize variations in energy efficiency given a
CPU model could very useful in the design process. There already exists some
such solutions, the most known might be Wattch\cite{brooks2000wattch},
McPAT\cite{hpmcpat,li2013mcpat} and CACTI\cite{hpcacti}. The different existing
solutions utilize different parameters and specialize in slightly different
tasks.

NTNU have a long tradition of using M5/gem5 for simulation purposes, and it
would be most beneficial for the SHMAC project if such solutions could be
applied to an unmodified version of gem5. Wattch seems to be a good fit, but it
only works with SimpleScalar\cite{wattchanalysis}. McPAT worked with the old
M5\cite{m5mcpatparser}, which joined with GEMS to become gem5\cite{gem5hipeac},
but seems to have problems with the latest versions of
gem5\cite{mcpatgem5problems}. CACTI is a system for understanding trade-offs
between power, area and performance within memory
systems\cite{hpcacti,muralimanohar2010memory}. Both McPAT and Wattch uses models
and methods found in CACTI\cite{li2009mcpat}.

The immediate lack of a system that is easy to use and easy to set up motivates
the creation of a new tool that works on a higher level. PET is such a tool,
which is able to estimate power usage per time for a given workload on a given
architecture.  It will use an energy metric profile estimated from similar
processors together with a simulator trace log to calculate energy usage.  Using
this approach, PET will be able to detect if hardware modifications done to the
simulation level model will be beneficial in the realized hardware. PET will
also tell if a processor-implementation is more energy efficient than an other
given a specific workloads, thus it can help building workload optimized tiles
for the SHMAC project\cite{shmacwebpage}. Using the features of PET, one can
also adjust the energy metric profile and simulate power usage as if one
component was cheaper or more expensive in terms of energy. This will enable the
hardware designers to understand where optimizations are most beneficial.
