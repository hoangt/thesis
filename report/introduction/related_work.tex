Butko et. al.\cite{butko2012accuracy} evaluated the accuracy of the gem5
simulator against a Snowball SKY-S9500-ULP-C01 containing a dual core 1GHz ARM
Cortex-A9.  Their work reports very good accuracy for benchmarking workloads,
with runtime accuracy reported between 1.23\% and 35.31\%.  Most of the tests
were well within 6\% mismatch, but the tests containing a high number of
L2-misses had a high runtime discrepancy between hardware and simulation. Butko et. al.
utilized the SimpleTiming CPU model and the basic memory system of gem5.

Pusderis et. al. \cite{pusdesrissources} evaluated errors in full system
simulation using gem5, and found that with proper modelling of the CPU model
and memory system, they got a mean runtime error of 17\% when running the PARSEC
test suite and 13\% running SPEC CPU2006. Their research is based on a ARM
Versatile Express TC2 development board containing an ARM Cortex-A15, a modified
ARM Out-of-order CPU model for gem5 and some adjustments to the memory model.

This work is based on Runde et. al.\cite{rundehvatum2013exploring} where isolated
power drain of different instructions where measured.
