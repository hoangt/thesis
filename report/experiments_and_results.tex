\chapter{Experiments and Results}

We have built PET and trained it to match our reference hardware. Now, a control
test is used to verify that the result is good for the general problem, not only
the specific instances used for training. This chapter will describe and discuss
the test benches used for evaluation as well as the results. It will also
discuss challenges in simululation level power estimation.
