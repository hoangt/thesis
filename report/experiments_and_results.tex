\chapter{Experiments and Results}

We have now build PET and tuned it to an existing architecture. The remaining
task is now to figure out how well it works. This chapter will describe and
discuss the test benches used for evaluation as well as the results. It will
also compare PET's performance to the theoretically best power estimations
obtainable on the simulation level.
