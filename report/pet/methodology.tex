\section{Methodology}

While computer architecture simulators have been around for quite some time,
energy estimation techniques is a more recent necessity. Song et. al
\cite{song2012instruction} identifies three major approaches to processor power
modelling used in the past, and introduces an instruction-based energy
estimation model that can be used for energy simulation at high speed. Their
proposed method is expressed through the following equation and includes the
desired features of past energy models.

\[
    P_{core}(t) = \frac{E_{unit} \cdot A_{datapath} \cdot w(t) +
    E_{static}}{T_{sampling}}
\]

This method depends on two things. First, one must know sufficient details of
the processor to identify datapath components in order to form the
$A_{datapath}$ matrix. Secondly, the energy unit vector $E_{unit}$ requires
circuit-level knowledge of the target processor. The former information can
often be found by reverse engineering and benchmarking, however, the latter is
rarely available for commercial processors. When building the model for PET, we
simplify the model from \cite{song2012instruction} by combining $A_{datapath}$
and $E_{unit}$ to form a vector of weights that directly corresponds to the cost
of an event. We can then model energy by the following formula.

\[
    P_{core}(t) = \frac{C \cdot w(t) + E_{static}}{T_{sampling}}
\]

Here, C represents the global cost vector -- a matrix enumerating the cost
for all event types. Please note that it is global and do not depend on time.

The choice of events/workload metrics is an important part of our method. We
account for two types of events; CPU instruction events and memory activity
events.

A major design choice made on how PET should be designed was to decide whether
it should be a standalone program or incorporated into an existing simulator.
There already exists a lot of computer architecture simulators, all with
strengths and weaknesses. Often, simulators only supports a small set of
architectures, memory systems and CPU models, and they only excel in simulating
one specific combination.

\subsection{A brief comparison of simulators}
\label{subsec:design_choices}
There are quite few active and open projects trying to estimate power
consumption of unimplemented platforms. Since the public available information
regarding such approches are sparse, this thesis will try to reason some about
the design choices on its own.


\begin{table}
    \begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c}
        Name    &   Simulated Architectures & Active & License & Notes \\
        \hline
        gem5    &   Alpha, & Yes & BSD/MIT/LGPL & in-house experience \\
        MARSSx86&   X86-64 & Yes & GPL-v2       &                     \\

    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Power Consuming Events}
It is desirable to estimate energy consumption on literally all types of
compututing systems, ranging from large-size clusters to embedded systems. To
provide this flexibility it was decided to write the tool as simulator agnostic
as possible, tracking \emph{simulator events} rather than executed instructions.
A simulator event is defined as a unit of work that uses a specified amount of
energy, and increases modelled energy consumption to the simulated time. We
defined a set of simulator events that PET should consider. The selected events
are briefly described in \autoref{tbl:events}.

gem5 was used as a basis for development and the only simulation front-end
implemented.




- ARM support (Sniper has not)

QEMU -- feil abstraksjonsnivå/formål
McPat - multicore, power AND AREA???? Optimizer
CACTI - cache power estimation
gem5 is flexible because
- it is easy to add new processor architectures
- memory system
=> in-house experience

LLVM traces?
