\section{Output}
\label{sec:output}

When a log file is consumed by PET, the output should be usable for many
applications. In early stages of the design phase, or when great differences are
expected, a sparse annotated graphical output might be the best way of
visualizing power consumption. As the project evolves and more subtle changes
are evaluated, a textual output will be easier to compare. PET supports three
different output options:

\begin{description}
    \item[graph]\hfill\\
        This format is the default, and provides an overview of
        the entire program in an easily digestible format. An example of such
        a graph is printed in \autoref{fig:annot}.
    \item[plain]\hfill\\
        The example in \autoref{lst:pet_output_plain} shows the \emph{plain}
        format, which is intended to be used for further machine processing.
    \item[table]\hfill\\
        The table format, with an example shown in
        \autoref{lst:pet_output_table}, shows a terminal-printable output which
        is easier to read. It might come in handy as the default format might be
        hard to read when you are looking for specific information.
\end{description}

\subsection{Units}

The output format is understood as timeslots in which the architecture has a
certain current drain, which should be multiplied with applied voltage to get
consumed energy. The values are given as milliamperes, equal to milliwatt if
voltage is $1~V$. Milliamperes are used as it is easier to find current drain
rather than wattage with the setup used in this project, as described in
\autoref{sec:energymeasure}. When power is estimated for a new architecture, the
resistance of the circuit is difficult to deduce, and voltage might also be an
unknown factor. Given Ohms law in \autoref{eq:ohm} and the definition of
electric power in \autoref{eq:power}

\begin{equation}
I=\frac{U}{R}
\label{eq:ohm}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
P=U \cdot I
\label{eq:power}
\end{equation}

it can be found that power equals current squared times resistance

\[U=R \cdot I\]
\[P=(R \cdot I) \cdot I\]
\begin{equation}
P=I^2 \cdot R
\label{eq:currentsquared}
\end{equation}
and that power equals voltage squared divided by resistance
\[P=U \cdot \frac{U}{R}\]
\begin{equation}
P=\frac{U^2}{R}
\label{eq:voltagesquared}
\end{equation}

Thus, estimating only the current drain means that the power at each point will
be unknown without knowing resistance or voltage. Further, energy consumption
cannot be estimated unless the new architecture is similar in terms of voltage
and resistance to a chip where these numbers are available. Even the current
drain might not be representable at all; if resistance or voltage is unequal to
the levels found in the reference chip, the final numbers will be far off.

\autoref{eq:currentsquared} and \autoref{eq:voltagesquared} states how voltage
and current is important for energy consumption. The current is, from
\autoref{eq:ohm}, dependent on resistance as well as voltage. With this in mind,
and knowing that power in a complex environment is a delicate matter, the most
important application for PET is to point in the right direction. PET will never
give accurate power estimations for new chips, but will provide useful
information for seeing if a new feature or architectural fix will render the
final architecture more energy efficient or not.


\subsection{Examples of Output Data}

Visualization is often a good thing when inspecting old or trying to understand
new problems. \autoref{fig:annot} shows an example of PET \texttt{graph} output
format, with annotations.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figs/annot.pdf}
    \caption{PET graphical output. This example contains annotations, each label
    represents the entrance of a function.}
    \label{fig:annot}
\end{figure}

Example of the \texttt{plain} output format can be seen in
\autoref{lst:pet_output_plain}. The left column is the bucket number, while the
right column is instant current draw from the modeled architecture.

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none,float=hbt,label={lst:pet_output_plain},caption={PET plain output with function annotations.}]
0 120 memcpy
1 113 start
2 150 main
3 123 main
4 133 fun1
5 117 main
\end{lstlisting}

When reading the output directly from console, a more descriptive output format
is the \texttt{table} format. An example using this option is rendered in
\autoref{lst:pet_output_table}.

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none,float=hbt,label={lst:pet_output_table},caption={PET table output with function annotations.}]

|          1 | 113.000000 |    start     |
|          2 | 150.000000 |    main      |
|          3 | 123.000000 |    main      |
|          4 | 133.000000 |    fun1      |
|          5 | 117.000000 |    main      |
