PET is a tool for power estimation of new as well as old architectures. It is
built by measuring real hardware with great detail, capturing discrete events
and assigning each event a certain energy cost. As depicted in
\autoref{fig:workflow}, when selected events have been weighted, one can run the
test program through a simulator set up to act as the new hardware. The
simulator will generate a tracelog containing the weighted events, and PET can
then apply the numbers. From this workflow, PET can produce a data set
containing power consumption distributed over the simulation lifetime. As noted,
the new hardware will be weighted equally of a chosen existing hardware, so so
this method requires a certain similarity beteen the new and the old hardware.
In general, all traditional architectures contains equal principles of function,
and is thus mappable to each other, but accuracy will of course differ as
hardware differs in design, applied voltage, clock speed and process technology.

When estimating power usage for new architectures, it is difficult to know which
events to pick and assign a cost to it. One will have to assume that the new
architecture is comparable to an old architecture, such that one can use the old
power estimation numbers to guide a new estimate. For instance, one can
experiment with a larger L2 cache to see how it affects energy usage (and
performance). The additional energy a larger L2 cache uses can be found from
existing implementations.
