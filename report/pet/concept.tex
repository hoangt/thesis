\section{Concept}
The goal for PET and this project is to ultimatly estimate power usage and thus also
energy efficiency of still not yet implemented computer architectures. A such approach
will of cource reside well within the term "estimation" and will doubtly reach the correct
numbers. Never the less, PET is built by measuring real hardware with great detail, capturing
discrete events and assigning each event a certain amount of energy consumption.

When selected events have been weighted, one can run a simulation of similar hardware, retreive
a trace of 

When estimating power usage for new architectures,
