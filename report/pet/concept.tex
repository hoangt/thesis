\section{Concept}
The goal for PET and this project is to ultimatly estimate power usage and thus also
energy efficiency of still not yet implemented computer architectures. A such approach
will of cource reside well within the term "estimation" and will doubtly reach the correct
numbers. Never the less, PET is built by measuring real hardware with great detail, capturing
discrete events and assigning each event a certain amount of energy consumption.

When selected events have been weighted, one can run a simulation of similar hardware, retreive
a tracelog containing these events, and then apply the numbers. PET is then able to produce a data set
containing power consumption distributed over the simulation lifetime.

When estimating power usage for new architectures, it is hard to tell exactly how to chose events and
how expensive each event is. Therefore, we have to assume that the new architecture is comparable to
an old architecture, and thus we can use the same power estimation numbers to give a new estimate.
