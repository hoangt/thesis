\section{Test Bench}
Explain how the physical test bench works, refering to our fall project and the
background chapter. Why is it important to have a focus on benchmarking, what
does it mean to get a good or a bad benchmark.

Dhrystone with 100000 reports that it is too small to contain any usefull information, but is sufficient for power measurement.
A shorter Dhrystone test will give shorter simulation time, shorter trace log and ease the computation power needed to run
a performance test for PET.

\cite{butko2012accuracy,pusdesrissources} talks about accuracy in gem5.
